Sipeed M1 uses the AI chip k210 of Kendryte as the core unit,dual core with independent FPU,64-bit CPU bit width,8M on-chip SRAM,adjustable nominal CPU frequency of 400M,FPU supports multiplication, division and square root double precision operations,

In the AI processing, k210 can perform convolution, batch normalization, activation, pooling, etc.At the same time, the pre-processing of voice direction scanning and voice data output can also be performed.

Sipeed has the following abilities

- Camera Interface (DVP)
- Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)
- Direct Memory Access Controler (DMAC)
- Inter－Integrated Circuit (I²C)
- Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
- Inter—IC Sound (I²S)
- Joint Test Action Group (JTAG)
- Field Programmable IO array(FPIOA/IOMUX)

What’s amazing is that Sipeed M1 also has

- Neural network processor (KPU)
- Audio processor (APU)
- Fast Fourier transform accelerator (FFT Accelerater)
- Advanced Encryption Standard Accelerater (AES Accelerater) 
- Secure Hash Algorithm Accelerater (SHA256 Accelerater)
